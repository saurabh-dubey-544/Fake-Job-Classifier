## Overview

Fake Job Classifier is an NLP project designed to detect fraudulent job postings. Using a dataset from Kaggle, this project leverages natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to differentiate between real and fake job postings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Real or Fake: Fake Job Posting Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction).

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, text normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data distributions and relationships.
- **Modeling:** Implements various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix.
